# School Library

> In this project I'm working with Ruby using OOP.

## Milestone 1:

✅ Created a new class called Person with the following methods: <br>

  - <code>initialize</code> as constructor <br>
  - <code>can_use_services?</code> <br>
  - <code>is_of_age?</code> as private method <br>
✅ Added setters and getters for name, age and id <br>
✅ Created a Student class that inherits from Person <br>
✅ Created a Teacher class that inherits from Person <br>

Override <code>can_use_services?</code> method thanks to polymorphism
